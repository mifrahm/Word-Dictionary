# Word Dictionary

In this project, I built a word dictionary that works by reading the words and phrases in an article, counting the number of occurrences and then storing this data into an AVL tree. 

The data is stored as an object called DATA with variables such as key (being the word itself) and frequency.

Once the AVL tree is populated with words and/or phrases, a number of operations can be performed on it such as outputting words into a dictionary file, loading that dictionary file again and searching for similar words.
